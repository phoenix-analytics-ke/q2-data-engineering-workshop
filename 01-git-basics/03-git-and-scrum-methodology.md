### Scrum Overview

Scrum is an agile methodology used to developer software.  It has iterations of 2 

weeks.  Chunks  of works are described as `features` and those features can be 

broken down into smaller chunks of  works called Stories.  `The 2 week iteration is 

called a sprint`.  Features and their stories are placed in a holding area called a backlog

The product owner orders stories in the product backlog so that those with highest 

priority are at the top.  



At the beginning of the sprint stories are taken from the backlog and placed into the 

sprint.   The team votes on how many points each story is.  The points are a relative 

measurement.   The team remembers a story from the past of similar complexity and 

compares the story against the  story being pointed.  They use the points of that past 

story to estimate the points of the new story.  The points are whole numbers so the 

easiest task is worth one point.  A story of 2 points needs twice the effort of a story on 

1 point (roughly). At the end of a sprint the number of stories deployed to production 

are counted.  This count is called the velocity.   If a story fails to be delivered to 

production it is moved to the next sprint and is not counted for the current sprint.  



Over time the velocity of a sprint should be similar to the velocity of previous sprints.  

This velocity gives predictability.   A new feature can be broken down to stories and 

those stories pointed.   As we have a velocity based on historical 

data it becomes easy to estimate how long a feature will take to implement and deploy 

to production.
